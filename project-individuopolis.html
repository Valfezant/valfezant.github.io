      <p>
        <em>Individuopolis</em> is a game where you have to examine fantastical creatures 
        and decide whether they classify as a person or an object.<br>
        <br>
        In a distant, post-apocalyptic land, the exploitation of the planet caused 
        a global resource crisis, leading to the fall of almost all urban centers. 
        You are the official Inspector for Individuopolis, the only city left standing, 
        and it is your job to accurately classify all which attempts to cross its borders: 
        persons are allowed entry; objects are to be terminated and turned into resources.<br>
        <br>
        A number of different creatures, referred to as “entisons”, will find themselves 
        before you, asking you to be granted access to the city. You will have to examine 
        and interact with them, to determine their level of consciousness and ultimately 
        decide their fate.
      </p>
    </div>



    <div class="projectDescriptionBox">
      <h3>The consciousness problem</h3>
      <p>
        The game examines the problem of consciousness: from our external perspective, 
        it’s impossible to tell whether something truly is conscious, and it’s only the 
        conscious creature itself who can become aware of its own consciousness. 
        And yet, it’s only an external entity, removed from the specific experience of 
        the individual, that can classify the whole – and, in turn, feel the weight of 
        making such decisions.<br>
        <br>
        Given the impossible nature of this question, the game never openly confirms 
        or disproves the player’s choices: the final answer is deeply personal and fully 
        dependent on individual perception, and thus should be left to the player.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="projectDescriptionBox">
      <h3>The Entisons</h3>
      <p>
        The entisons, the creatures the player must classify, are intended to force 
        the player to reflect on specific themes and expand the scope of the basic 
        question to its extremes. As such, they are all wildly different from each other, 
        almost belonging to different universes entirely. They can resemble realistic 
        creatures, inanimate objects, and everything in-between.<br>
        <br>
        Each represents a different example of life. The player is first presented with 
        a human life, one familiar and plausible, to serve as a starting reference and 
        point of comparison for the rest of the entisons. From there, more unusual forms 
        of life can follow: alien/incomprehensible life, animal life, plant life, organic life, 
        artificial life, and more ambiguous interpretations of the subject.<br>
        <br>
        While all entisons were designed by loosely fitting them into one of three categories 
        (“person”, “object”, “ambigous”) for ease of planning and pacing, these definitions 
        never appear explicitly in-game. The only relevant classification is that determined 
        by the player themselves.
      </p>

      <h4>The Pebbletons</h4>
      <div class="projectDescriptionImages">
        <a href="IMGs/ProjectMedia/Individuopolis/Indi_pebbletons.png" target="_blank" id="imageLink">
          <img src="IMGs/ProjectMedia/Individuopolis/Indi_pebbletons.png" alt="Sprites of Pebbleton Jr. and Sr.">
        </a>
        <p>Pebbleton Jr. and Pebbleton Sr.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Pebbleton Jr. and Pebbleton Sr. appear one after the other. The former is a simple, 
        mundane rock, and doesn’t say a word: it follows our preconceptions of what an object is, 
        and so the player is naturally led to classify at such.<br>
        <br>
        However, the mere appearance of Pebbleton Sr., who looks identical but bears a highly humanising feature 
        (a fancy hat) and openly inquires about its son, subverts that notion, recontextualising 
        the previous encounter entirely.<br>
        <br>
        This exchange serves as a turning point in the player’s examination, as it shines a light on 
        our reliance on our expectations, and on just how quickly they can be influenced by mere details.

        <p>The Lamb, the Broiler Chicken, and the Bear</p>
      </div>
      <h4>Animal life</h4>
      <p>
        Amidst the entisons are a number of animals, ranging from highly humanised to highly dehumanised. 
        Playing on widespread stereotypes regarding their respective species, the Lamb is cute and articulate, 
        the Broiler Chicken appears dull and slow, and the Bear seems inscrutable and menacing – but all 
        are real-life animals.<br>
        <br>
        The player is forced to confront their own biases and the consistency of their choices in the face 
        of significant variations in our cultural standards.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="projectDescriptionBox">
      <h3>The player’s perspective</h3>
      <p>
        Since the main conflict of the game is based around a personal philosophical reflection, 
        it was essential to fully involve the player within the narrative, and ensure that each choice 
        they make is deliberate and carefully considered.<br>
        <br>
        There is no time limit during the examination, as this allows the player to ponder each matter 
        seriously and have an internal debate entirely driven by their own personal values and perspectives. 
        The consequences of the player’s performance (that is, how many entisons they classify as objects) 
        are exclusively narrative: there is no hard fail state to be avoided, so as to not impose any 
        authoritative external judgement of the player’s choices. To this same end, the player is never 
        revealed whether their classifications of the entisons is accurate or not.<br>
      </p>
      <div class="projectDescriptionImages">
        <a href="IMGs/ProjectMedia/Individuopolis/Indi_Evaluation.png" target="_blank" id="imageLink">
          <img src="IMGs/ProjectMedia/Individuopolis/Indi_Evaluation.png" alt="Player evaluation example">
        </a>
        <p>Player evaluation example</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        The game will try to subvert the player’s expectation and sow doubt in many ways, emphasising 
        the uncertain and unanswerable nature of the consciousness question, and will place the player 
        in the uncomfortable position of being the only person fully responsible for that final, 
        inevitably partial decision.<br>
        <br>
        At the end of a playthrough, the player is shown a small, humorous evaluation of their choices, 
        in the form of a list of characteristics shared by all the entisons they classified as persons. 
        This is a lighthearted attempt to rationalise and standardize their decisions, which, in actuality, 
        will generally have been driven by a visceral intuition and personal experience, more than any 
        tangible quality of the creature in question.
