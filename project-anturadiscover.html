        <em>Antura: Discover</em> is an educational game that teaches about European culture through 
        exploration, character interaction, and minigames.<br>
        <br>
        <a href="https://antura.org/en/" target="_blank"><em><b>Antura</b></em></a> is an open-source project that aims to teach children through the video game medium. 
        The original game focused on teaching languages and reading. The new Discover section, 
        which I worked on, expands to teach the culture of some European countries as well.<br>
        <br>
        The game is designed to be played in class, by children attending elementary school. 
        For this reason, it is lightweight, portable (including builds for mobile platforms), 
        and using simple input schemes. Each play session should be short, so that it can be 
        followed up with a pertinent lesson by the teachers. The content of each quest is suggested, 
        and later validated, by teachers from the relevant countries.
      </p>
    </div>


    <div class="projectDescriptionBox">
      <h3>My role</h3>
      <p>
        I was hired as a junior designer for two months, in preparation for the game’s beta. 
        My tasks were to further develop quest drafts, design minigames, implement quests in engine, 
        find  necessary CC0 images for the project, and testing.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="projectDescriptionBox">
      <h3>Quest design</h3>
      
      <p>
        I was given some quest drafts to develop and finalise so that they could be implemented. 
        The topics and facts presented by the quests had been provided by teachers, and a loose 
        gameplay direction was often present. I greatly expanded the drafts, following the outlined 
        experience and preserving the teaching content, but updating the gameplay to respect the project’s 
        equirements and limitations.
        <div class="projectDescriptionImages">

          <img src="IMGs/ProjectMedia/Antura Discover/Antura_Screenshot3.png" alt="A chef giving instructions" >
        </a>
        <p>A character giving Task instructions</p>
      </div>
        <br>
        I wanted quests to be fun and engaging, obfuscating the teaching moments to encourage the player 
        to interact further with the game. Each quest focuses on teaching a specific set of topics or themes, 
        like foods or the French education system. They each feature a simple, self-contained story to 
        justify the tasks given to the player, which must be resolved with the conclusion of the quest.<br><br> 
        The setting of a quest will also allow for some digression: rewards and more characters to interact 
        with are hidden behind exploration and platforming, encouraging the player to be curious, experiment 
        within the game environment, and think independently.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="projectDescriptionBox">
      <h4>Focus on learning</h4>
        <div class="projectDescriptionImages">
          <a href="IMGs/ProjectMedia/Antura Discover/Antura_Coins.png" target="_blank" id="imageLink">
            <img src="IMGs/ProjectMedia/Antura Discover/Antura_Coins.png" alt="Coins and banknotes on a counting mat">
          </a>
          <p>The money counting minigame</p>
        </div>
      <p>
        I integrated opportunities for learning throughout the entirety of quests: aside from the spoken 
        interaction with quest characters, who outline the themes and directly communicate facts to the player, 
        progress within quests is also bound to spatial navigation, minigames, and conscious examination. 
        I often replaced a simple interaction from the draft with a more interesting and involved puzzle for 
        the player.<br><br>For example, in one quest, accessing the requested items requires the player to choose 
        the relevant and respectful dialogue option, and then count enough money to pay for it.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="projectDescriptionBox">
      <br>
      <h4>Minigames</h4>
      <p>
        The minigames were developed to offer more frequent interaction to the player, and often act as a 
        condition to advance the quest. They’re short and intuitive, tactile and satisfying to complete. 
        They include traditional games of widespread appeal, such as jigsaw puzzles and matching cards, 
        and tests of dexterity or logic, such as clearing a canvas or counting coins. Thanks to their 
        self-contained nature, they could be injected throughout a complete quest, or tied directly to progress.
      </p>

      </div>
      <h4>Dialogue</h4>
      <p>
        In <em>Antura</em>, a quest’s setting and narrative are mainly communicated through text, spoken by the 
        characters upon player interaction. Each text box holds a small amount of text, so as to appear clear 
        and legible to the player: as such, the dialogue must be written in a very simple and direct form, 
        understandable even when broken up in short sentences. I made sure to characterise the dialogue 
        whenever possible, combining clear explanations with memorable facts regarding each character.
      </p>

      <h3>Quest implementation</h3>
      <div class="projectDescriptionImages">
        <a href="IMGs/ProjectMedia/Antura Discover/Antura_Secret.png" target="_blank" id="imageLink">
          <img src="IMGs/ProjectMedia/Antura Discover/Antura_Secret.png" alt="A chest hidden in a circle of trees">
        </a>
        <p>A secret reward</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Once the quests I’d revised had been validated, I worked on their implementation in engine. 
        I created the environments for each quest using the available models and set up the interactable 
        characters. The layout of the scene follows the quest progression, gently guiding the player 
        through the various interactions in the desirable order. The addition of decorations, secrets, 
        and bonus collectables creates a more engaging and detailed game space for the player to explore.<br>
        <br>
        The project uses the tool YarnSpinner to manage the dialogues. I adapted the previously-written 
        dialogue to Yarn scripts to create the playable quests, making use of the project’s bespoke 
        functions available to me to start minigames, activate objects, integrate small animations, 
        and keep track of quest progress.
