        <em>The Adblocker</em> is a stealth game where you must sneak into the offices 
        of a company that’s flooding the world with pop-ups and destroy their servers.<br>
        <br>
        In a near future where everyone is wearing XR visors to better browse 
        the internet, big companies constantly produce and share pop-ups to 
        advertise their products directly to the eyes of both the public and 
        their own workers. The protagonist decides to infiltrate one of these 
        companies, to end the AI that took over their operations.<br>
        <br>
        The player must get through each floor without being noticed by the workers. 
        Over time, they will also receive pop-ups to block their vision and 
        threaten their cover: they have to be manually closed, but some can 
        also be shared with the workers, turning them from a hindrance into a tool.

      <h3>Team Project</h3>
      <p>
        I was one of two game designers working on the project. 
        My main responsibilities, aside from updating the GDD and keeping 
        weekly progress logs, were designing the Pop-ups and UI/UX. 
        I also contributed some level design.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="projectDescriptionBox">
      <h3>Pop-Ups</h3>
      <div class="projectDescriptionImages">
        <a href="IMGs/ProjectMedia/TheAdblocker/Adblocker_Popups.png" target="_blank" id="imageLink">
          <img src="IMGs/ProjectMedia/TheAdblocker/Adblocker_Popups.png" alt="Pop-up examples">
        </a>
        <p>Pop-up examples</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        When the player approaches Transmitters, pop-ups will appear on their screen. 
        Clicking on the “close” button will remove them, while the “share” button allows 
        them to be passed onto enemies or objects in the scene. Sharable pop-ups exist 
        in three types, each with a different use: image (block the enemy’s vision for 
        a few seconds), audio (attract enemies towards them), and object (block enemies’ path).<br>
        <br>
        <em>The Adblocker</em> revolves around pop-ups. They serve as both the main conflict and 
        main mechanic of the game. It was important that they be balanced properly, 
        resulting in an interesting obstacle that's fun to interact with. Interaction 
        with them is required frequently to proceed, and the sharing method is easy and intuitive.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="projectDescriptionBox">
      <h4>Transmitters</h4>
      <div class="projectDescriptionImages">
        <a href="IMGs/ProjectMedia/TheAdblocker/Adblocker_Transmitter.png" target="_blank" id="imageLink">
          <img src="IMGs/ProjectMedia/TheAdblocker/Adblocker_Transmitter.png" alt="Transmitter">
        </a>
        <p>A transmitter sending sharable pop-ups</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        The pop-ups were designed to emulate real-life pop-up ads, both in appearance and function: 
        they are big and numerous, quickly covering the screen with bright graphics if left unchecked. 
        To regulate their frequency and control the flow of gameplay, they can only be received 
        from Transmitters, deliberately placed around the environment to best suit the level design.<br>
        <br>
        Each Transmitter always shares the same types of pop-ups, indicated by the colour of the 
        light it casts, in regular intervals, allowing the player to strategise. 
        This way we could also ensure that the player always has access to the pop-ups required 
        to beat the level, even if they close the first one they receive.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="projectDescriptionBox">
      <h4>Pop-Up Visuals</h4>
      <p>
        As is expected of spam, pop-ups in <em>The Adblocker</em> are colourful and often garish, 
        serving to catch the player’s attention and act as small distractions. 
        They often include jokes and amusing references. Still, to avoid them becoming 
        overwhelming and confusing the player when they need to interact with them, 
        they are generally consistent in colour and layout, and the "calls to action" 
        they contain are clearly distinct from the actual clickable buttons used in the game.
        In addition, the different types of sharable pop-ups are identified by their dominating colour, 
        making them clearly recognisable. I worked closely with the Concept Art department 
        to develop the pop-ups’ visual identity, test numerous variations, 
        and adapt them to gameplay needs.

      <h4>UI/UX</h4>
      <p>
        The pop-up motif was also integrated in the game’s menus, though adapted to be cleaner 
        and more easily readable. Each menu is depicted as a pop-up, with every option to exit 
        a menu or quit the game being represented by the unmistakable “X” atop most pop-ups, 
        mirroring the action frequently performed during gameplay.

        <p>Level 2 first layout</p>
      </div>
      <h4>Level Design</h4>
      <p>
        Each level was designed with the purpose of teaching the player about one or more aspects 
        of the game, acting as one part of the skill chain. Starting from the relative skill, 
        the floor layout was then developed, adding enemies and transmitters to determine the 
        player’s expected route and force interaction with the newly introduced mechanic. 
        The level was then built in engine, and tweaked after testing.
