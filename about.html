      <p>
        I'm Valeria Passarella, a junior game designer from Italy.

        Ever since I was a child, I've always been interested in 
        artistic expression and storytelling. Over the years I’ve 
        dedicated countless hours to drawing, writing, and generally 
        experimenting with different artistic mediums.<br>
        <br>
        I fell in love with video games because of their unique potential 
        for truly immersive experiences and innovative storytelling. 
        They allow us to create worlds untethered to the rules of our 
        reality, capable of evoking specific and intense sensations, 
        and still make them feel real. Being able to walk around a 
        purposefully designed game environment, personally living an 
        adventure and feeling like a real part of the world, is an 
        amazing opportunity, the culmination of the tight collaboration 
        between writing, visual art, and sound design that is only 
        possible in video games. Interactivity and individual experience 
        are at the core of this medium, making each playthrough feel personal and special. <br>
        <br><br>
        I want to contribute to this artform, to make others live 
        memorable stories like the ones I was able to live in my 
        favourite games. I like to focus on designing unique concepts 
        and systems, and creating remarkable, meaningful experiences 
        for the player. I'm eager to experiment and try new approaches. <br>
        <br>
        In 2025 completed a three-year course in Game Design at 
        <a href="https://thesign.academy/" target="_blank">TheSIGN Comics & Arts Academy</a> in Florence, Italy. That same year 
        I worked as a quest designer for <a href="https://antura.org/en/" target="_blank"><em>Antura: Discover</em></a>, an award-winning 
        project with a focus on integration and learning. I’m comfortable 
        prototyping every aspect of a project, including design, 
        graphics, and scripting in C#.<br>
        <br><br>
        In my free time, I like to draw, write, whittle wood, go on 
        nature hikes, sew, read, and, of course, play video games. 
        I love animals and nature, and enjoy learning about biology 
        and ethology. My favourite games are <em>Deus Ex (2000)</em>, 
        the <em>Portal</em> series, <em>Team Fortress 2</em>, <em>The Witness</em>, <em>Death Stranding</em>, 
        <em>Half-Life 2</em>, and <em>Hotline Miami</em>.
