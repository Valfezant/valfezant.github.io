        <em>Space Delivery Guy</em> is a top-down shooter with a cargo management element. 
        Drive your ship through pirate-infested routes using your packages to defend yourself,
        but be careful not to destoy them!<br>
        <br>
        The game screen is divided in two parts: the Space Section, where the player drives their 
        ship to avoid or destroy enemies, and the Cargo Section, which shows the effects of the 
        ship’s movement onto the packages.<br>
        <br>
        The player controls only the Space Section directly, while the Cargo Section is affected 
        by the movement of the ship. Inside of the cargo hold, placing certain coloured packages 
        onto the corresponding platforms will grant a defensive or offensive upgrade to the ship.

      <h3>Team Project</h3>
      <p>
        I was one of two game designers working on the project. I contributed to the game as a 
        whole (concept elaboration and gameplay development, writing and updating the GDD, testing), 
        but I mainly focused on designing the packages, Cargo Section, and UI/UX.<br>
        <br>
        As team leader, I also organised the team, determined and assigned tasks, and kept weekly logs 
        of feedback and goals.

      <h3>The Cargo Section</h3>
      <!--<div class="projectDescriptionImages">

        </a>
      </div>-->
      <p>
        The Cargo Section, along with the packages inside it, is at the heart of the concept. 
        They must receive part of the player’s attention at all times, and they set <em>SpaceDeliveryGuy</em> 
        apart from other space-themed top-down shooters. For these reasons, we wanted them to be an 
        integral part of the gameplay, interesting and fun to interact with, but also clear and intuitive.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="projectDescriptionBox">
      <h4>The Packages</h4>
      <p>
        Packages come in three types: green, red (which can activate the player’s cannons), and blue 
        (which can recharge the player’s armor). HP and weight vary depending on the type and size, 
        but all will be damaged by crashing against the walls of the cargo hold or each other. 
        At the end of each day, the player can earn money by selling their packages: this encourages 
        the player to care for their cargo and avoid risky manoeuvres that would destroy their packages.<br>
        <br>
        Multiple packages can be active at the same time, with red packages granting different kinds 
        of shot depending on their shape and allowing for different pattern combinations. 
        The player is thus motivated to seek out more packages and hold on to them even when they 
        already have one of each type.<br>
        <br>
        Especially on harder levels, packages will break regularly for most players. To mediate this, 
        and ensure that the player always has at least some healthy packages inside their cargo hold, 
        random packages can be found floating in space or dropped by destroyed enemies, ensuring an 
        almost constant turnover.<br>
        <br>
        During any playthrough, packages will be moving around a lot inside the cargo hold: the different 
        colours and shapes make them immediately recognisable at a glance, even in the middle of the action.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="projectDescriptionBox">
      <h4>The Cargo Hold</h4>
      <div class="projectDescriptionImages">
        <a href="IMGs/ProjectMedia/SpaceDeliveryGuy/SDG_CargoHold.png" target="_blank" id="imageLink">
          <img src="IMGs/ProjectMedia/SpaceDeliveryGuy/SDG_CargoHold.png" alt="HUD SDG_HUDsketch">
        </a>
      </div>
      <p>
        In designing the cargo room I experimented with a few different shapes and layouts allowing for 
        different interactions between it and the packages. We settled on a simple and readable layout, 
        with every platform being reachable at all times: two red platforms (which activate shot packages) 
        at the sides of the cargo hold, giving the player many opportunities to use them even when moving 
        around quickly, and one blue platform (which activates armor packages) at the far end, rewarding 
        a daring player which pushes forward with a defensive boost.<br>
        <br>
        At the center is an area which heals any packages that enter it, enhancing the overall durability 
        of the player’s stock. A few short walls were later added after testing, sectioning the floor 
        space to help the player break up groups of packages and guide them to the intended platforms.<br>
        <br>
        The cargo hold is an essential part of the player’s interaction with the packages, but it must 
        not distract from them: for this reason, it’s spacious and plainly-textured, moody but unintrusive. 
        The platforms glow when active, making them stand out from the rest of the scene and clearly 
        indicating the status of the player’s upgrades.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="projectDescriptionBox">
      <h3>UI/UX</h3>
      <p>
        I closely worked with the Concept Art department to develop the game’s visual interface. 
        We wanted it to further enhance the chosen setting and artstyle, based on retrofuturism and the 
        series <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>, but it also needed to communicate a great amount of gameplay information 
        in a clear and concise way.<br>
        <br>
        To contribute to the game’s unique identity and keep with the stated visual inspirations, 
        we wanted the UI to feel like a physical object, like the ship’s control panel itself. 
        As such, some of its elements emulate analog knobs and buttons, and all digital items such 
        as health bars are presented on tiny displays, rather than abstractly superimposed on the interface.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="projectDescriptionBox">
      <h4>The HUD</h4>
      <div class="projectDescriptionImages">
        <a href="IMGs/ProjectMedia/SpaceDeliveryGuy/SDG_HUDsketch.png" target="_blank" id="imageLink">
          <img src="IMGs/ProjectMedia/SpaceDeliveryGuy/SDG_HUDsketch.png" alt="HUD SDG_HUDsketch">
        </a>
        <p>Initial HUD sketch</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        The main HUD had to be split into two screens, one for each part of the core gameplay 
        (Driving and Cargo Sections). We decided on an asymmetrical split, as the simplified design of the 
        Cargo Section required less space to be clearly readable. The initial layout for the HUD 
        attempted to convey too much information, which made it appear cluttered and confusing.<br>
        <br> 
        To solve this, some non-essential mechanics were cut, and other UI elements were incorporated 
        into the game scene. For example, the indicator for the active platforms, initially a series 
        of lights and symbols, was replaced by the platforms themselves lighting up upon activation.  
      </p>
